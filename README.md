# About "covid-19-malaysia"
This repository hosts the dashboard Covid-19 Situation in Malaysia. It also contains:

- Rmd to generate the dashboard
- datasets in .csv formats

As of 23 July 2021, MOH, MOSTI & CITF started sharing data in github at https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public. So, some of the scripts with web scraping code are no longer useful.
- **scripts/** folder contains useful scripts that I used to scrape the data from the official press release on Covid-19 in Malaysia (described here: [Gist](https://gist.github.com/wnarifin/a608e60b6d35fdb369ee8133b30d36ab)).
